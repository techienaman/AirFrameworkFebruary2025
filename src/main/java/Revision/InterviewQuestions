Ans4-> IRetryAnalyzer Interface and RetryListner that implements IAnnotationTransformer have arguments as
ITestAnnotation annotation Class testClass, Constructor constructor, Methods testMethods

Actually if we dont use retry Listener then every time in the test case we have to add
retryanalyzer=RetryAnalyzer.class but by adding RetryListener the job will be done autmatically. It will check if RetryAnalzer.class is added or not if not the
it will add it.Just we need pass this in testng.xml file under listeners
Ans3-> Difference is that
TestNG supports parallel execution but junit doesn't provide support for parallel execution
TestNG also supports retry failed TestCases,using IRetry Analyzer
Supports dependencies using dependsOnMethods

Ans14->Difference between HashTable and HashMap is that.
Hashtable is synchronized meaning it is thread safe and hashmap is not thread safe
Hashtable doesnt allow null key and values   hashmao allows 1 null key and multiple values

Ans16->Exception Hirearchy
        Throwable
        Exception                     Error
        Unchecked Exception
          Null Pointer Exception
          IndexOutOfBoundException
          ArrayIndexOutofBoundException
          StringIndexOutofBound Exception



        Checked Exception
        FileNotFoundException
        Interrupted exception









Ans-27->A Functional Interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method but can have multiple default and static methods.
 It is mainly used to implement Lambda Expressions,
 which help in writing cleaner and more concise code by eliminating the need for creating separate classes for implementation."
